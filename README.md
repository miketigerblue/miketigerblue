# 🧠 Mike Harris (miketigerblue)

Technologist. Tinkerer. Builder of things that shouldn't work, but do.

Welcome to my personal lab — a space where I explore cyber threat intelligence, utility AI, resilient comms, and the occasional overengineered hobby project. I believe the best way to understand the future is to prototype it.

### ⚒️ Current Projects

- 🐾 **ThreatKitty** – AI-enhanced, gamified threat intelligence using Rivlet™ streams (Rust, Swift, MQTT)
- 🧹 **Reverse-engineering the Eufy X1 Pro** – LiDAR, 3D mapping, and the thin line between convenience and surveillance
- 📡 **PostgreSQL + Rust + MQTT** – Triggers as near-zero-cost event emitters in data pipelines
- 🧠 **Local LLM lab** – Comparing 8B / 32B / 70B models using DeepSeq + OpenWebUI

### 🪛 Things I Enjoy Working On

- ✳️ AI for Ops / Intelligence / Automation  
- 📡 Networking, signal resilience, IoT with dignity  
- 🧬 RAG pipelines + local-first models  
- 🔐 Cybersecurity & threat modelling  
- 🪞 Reverse engineering hardware for fun and clarity  
- ☕ Coffee-fuelled weekend builds, driven by a mix of spite and curiosity
